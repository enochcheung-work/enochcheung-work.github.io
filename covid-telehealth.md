## Telehealth during Covid-19 Pandemic

**Description** 

Telehealth has been around for quite some time and recently we've seen an exponential growth in usage during the pandemic period.  Usage of telehealth in Hong Kong had not been significant in the pre-pandemic period mainly because of the easiness of in-person consultations.  During the pandemic outbreak, the company I worked in had launched various telehealth campaigns with a hospitals and MNC pharmaceutical companies.  Here we are looking at:

- Telehealth trend throughout the 5th wave outbreak in 2022-2023
- Demographic distribution of telehealth patient
- My role and campaign challenges


### 1. Telehealth trend - 5th wave

The 5th wave outbreak started in late January 2022.  Blue line here is telehealth cases per day and the bars are reported confirmed covid cases.  We can see a very similar pattern between the two: both peaked in March and December, a mini outbreak in September and less utilisation of telehealth is other months.  Marketing efforts here may exacerbate the jump in telehealth cases during peak season but it doesn't takeaway the fact that utilisation of telehealth has increased due to the physical and law-restriction factors during pandemic.

The industry of telehealth is growing yet there are growing conceners on telehealth fatigue after the pandemic with people returning to face-to-face consultation.  We compare the ratio of in-person online appointment and the telehealth cases throughout the whole period.  All metrics are from organic to minimise marketing effect.  We first see the ratio surged to over 20% during peak pandemic months.  Despite the ratio cooling off together with number of covid cases in Hong Kong, we see a steady amount of telehealth cases in recent weeks where the ratio stas at 5%, comparing to 0%-2% before the mass adoption during 5th wave outbreak.  Most cases however are still covid-related appointment, whether the spillover effect will happen towards other non-pandemic healthcare service is reminad to be seen.

### 2. Demographic distribution of telehealth patient

Here is the overall age distribution of all telehtealth cases throughout the 5th wave outbreak, from Jan 2022 to Feb 2023.  Paitent are breaking down into six age group in total, starting with 0-20, 20-40 and end with 100+.  Distribution in some months however are distorted by covid marketing campaigns specifically designed for certain age group, namely, an infant susbisdy program from March-April and a covid oral drug pill program from July 2023 onwards.

From the overall 100% stacked chart we can see,
