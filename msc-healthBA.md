    This programme strengthened my understanding of how health systems function, how social and digital determinants influence outcomes, and how evidence can be translated into decision-relevant insights for health-related organisations.

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<div class="card">
  <h2>What I gained from the programme</h2>
  <p>
    The curriculum combines health economics, operations, innovation, and research methods. The emphasis is not only on technical tools, but on how institutional context, incentives, and social environment shape implementation feasibility and outcomes.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Systems-level understanding of healthcare delivery, policy context, and stakeholder incentives</li>
    <li>Evidence-informed decision-making under uncertainty (trade-offs, assumptions, scenarios)</li>
    <li>Research literacy and synthesis skills for translating complex evidence into clear narratives</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="professional-direction">How this complements my professional background</h3>
<div class="card">
  <h2>Link to my analytics experience</h2>
  <p>
    This academic training complements my professional experience in digital marketing analytics by adding a broader health-sector perspective. It strengthens my ability to interpret performance and adoption issues within system constraints, rather than treating user behaviour or metrics in isolation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Brings health systems and institutional context into business discussions</li>
    <li>Helps frame “why performance varies” using determinants and implementation constraints</li>
    <li>Supports clearer translation from evidence and analysis to stakeholder-facing recommendations</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="decision-capabilities">Decision capabilities</h3>
<div class="card">
  <h2>Decision capabilities developed through health economics and systems training</h2>
  <p>
    The programme emphasised structured thinking in complex decision environments where evidence is incomplete, stakeholders differ, and outcomes are uncertain.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluate health and healthcare initiatives using value-based reasoning, not single metrics</li>
    <li>Structure complex problems into comparable assumptions and scenarios</li>
    <li>Interpret empirical findings and translate them into decision-relevant narratives</li>
    <li>Identify operational and institutional constraints that affect feasibility and outcomes</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="systems-policy">Health systems, policy, and society</h3>
<div class="card">
  <h2>Institutional and social context</h2>
  <p>
    A core focus was understanding how health outcomes and intervention success are shaped by policy environments, institutional arrangements, and social conditions. The coursework highlighted that interventions do not operate in a vacuum, and that context often determines feasibility and sustainability.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How incentives and governance shape behaviour across patients, providers, and payers</li>
    <li>How equity considerations function as practical constraints on adoption and access</li>
    <li>How system context influences implementation success across settings</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="operations-innovation">Operations and innovation</h3>
<div class="card">
  <h2>Healthcare operations and innovation</h2>
  <p>
    The programme covered how operational capacity, variability, purchasing mechanisms, and innovation pathways influence service delivery. This supports more realistic evaluation of execution feasibility when analysing health-related initiatives in business or organisational settings.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Capacity constraints and variability in care delivery</li>
    <li>Incentive alignment across stakeholders and organisational boundaries</li>
    <li>Implementation challenges for new health technologies</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="research">Research and evidence synthesis</h3>
<div class="card">
  <h2>Research methods and evidence synthesis</h2>
  <p>
    The programme strengthened my research literacy and ability to extract structured insights from fragmented evidence. The focus was on methodological transparency and translating findings into usable narratives for decision contexts.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>PRISMA-guided systematic literature review methods</li>
    <li>Deductive thematic analysis for qualitative synthesis</li>
    <li>Critical appraisal of heterogeneous empirical studies</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 id="thesis">Master’s thesis</h3>
<div class="card">
  <h2>Master’s thesis — determinants and implementation constraints</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Digital and social determinants of health in e-health implementation</strong><br/>
    PRISMA-guided systematic review examining how social and digital determinants influence adoption and outcomes of digital health interventions in rural LMIC contexts.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Structured synthesis of multi-context empirical evidence</li>
    <li>Identification of implementation constraints and enabling conditions</li>
    <li>Evidence-based discussion of gaps in system-level factors in existing research</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Applied modelling project</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Norovirus vaccination strategy analysis</strong><br/>
    Excel-based quantitative analysis to compare strategies and support prioritisation decisions under uncertainty.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Structured scenario comparison and sensitivity testing</li>
    <li>Visual outputs for communicating trade-offs</li>
    <li>Workflow automation (VBA) to streamline repeated analysis and visuals</li>

  <h2>What this page represents</h2>
  <p>
    This academic work reflects my interest in how determinants of health and health system context shape outcomes, and how evidence can be translated into decision support for organisations operating in the health and healthcare sector.
