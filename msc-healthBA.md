  <h1>Applying MSc Health Business Administration to Digital Health Platform Analysis</h1>

<div class="meta meta-subtitle">
  MSc Business Administration – Health · University of Groningen · GPA 8.1 / 10 (Distinction)
</div>

  <p>
This programme strengthened my ability to apply health economics, systems thinking, and research methods to digital health platform analysis, supporting resource prioritisation, adoption strategy, and evidence-informed business decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Focus:</strong> Health systems and business decision-making, applied health economics,
    and strategy-oriented analysis for healthcare organisations.
