<p>
This programme strengthened my ability to apply health economics, systems thinking, and research methods to digital health platform analysis, supporting prioritisation, adoption strategy, and evidence-informed business decisions.
</p>

  </div>

  <p>
    <strong>Focus:</strong> Health systems and business decision-making, applied health economics, and strategy-oriented analysis for healthcare organisations.
