## Organic Traffic and Conversion Rate

**Description:** This illustration shows what examples used to examine the organic search performances across landing pages.  By combining SERP data on Search Console and data from Google Analytics and using landing page as the joining key, we can evaluate the performance of different aspects in SEO, their corresponding product-side performances and identify potentials.


### 1. Data Source

Here we use only Google Analytics and some Search Console Data.  Since the example here is web-based, much of the work can be done on Data Studio with its built-in GA integration.  Certain custom dimensions are used for GA and Session ID for the GA without 360.


### 2. Identify high potential products with SERP and GA data

Two major components in this chart is search impression and conversion rate.  Ideally we are looking for high organic search impressions, which signals a moderately good perfoming search rank and total search volume, and landing pages with high conversion rate.

### 3. Illustrate how SERP positions change over time for a given dimension

This **scatter Plot with movement arrows** best illustrates the changes in performance metrics for a given dimension within two static start-end dates.  Further examining the pop-up impact, we compare the change of average position and SERP Click-Through Rate between pre-launch and before withdrawal.  Choice of CTR neutralises the weight of landing pages and allows us to focus on individual changes.  The chart further supports the assumption that pop-up ad hinders SEO performance with the majority resulting a decrease in CTR and rank.


### 4. Does a higher rank in SERP means higher resistance in shock?

From the above observation we see some of our best performance landing pages held nicer than the others during the shock.  We want to see if there is a positive relationship between rank and resistance in major events.

Although not entirely significant, preliminarily we see that during W36 and W37, the weaker landing pages is more prone to decrease in rank.

Wrapping up, from the above illustrations, we can conclude that the introduction of pop-up ad did have an impact on SEO.  Still, we need further observation on whether the SERP position will restore.  Charts are quite versatile in working on other areas such as queries instead of landing pages or a longer term SEO monitoring instead of individual events.
