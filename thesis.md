  <h3 id="executive">Executive takeaway</h3>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>What this thesis is really about</h2>
    <p>
      Digital health adoption is not driven by technology alone.
      Across empirical studies, implementation outcomes are shaped by a wider health ecosystem,
      where social, institutional, and system-level factors interact with digital capabilities.
      While individual-level factors such as literacy and affordability are important,
      societal-level determinants such as norms, governance, and policy environments
      are frequently underexamined despite their influence on outcomes.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>
        <strong>So what?</strong>
        Scaling digital health platforms requires strategy beyond user-level optimisation,
        incorporating institutional constraints, system incentives, and context-specific
        adoption conditions.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Representative implementation pattern</h2>
    <p>
      Across the evidence base, many digital health interventions achieved initial uptake
      but failed to sustain usage over time. This was not due to technical shortcomings,
      but because solutions were introduced without sufficient alignment to existing care
      workflows, incentive structures, or regulatory contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, digital tools remained peripheral rather than embedded within routine
      service delivery, limiting adoption, network effects, and long-term value creation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Research focus -->
  <h3 id="focus">Research focus and scope</h3>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Research focus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core question:</strong> How does digital health implementation interact with health inequities across populations?</li>
      <li><strong>Context:</strong> Heterogeneous health systems with structurally constrained populations</li>
      <li><strong>Interventions:</strong> Mobile health, telemedicine, and platform-based digital health initiatives</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence base:</strong> Empirical studies reporting adoption, implementation, or equity-related outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Out of scope: clinical efficacy, algorithm performance, and financial cost-effectiveness modelling.

  </div>

  <!-- Key insights -->
  <h3 id="insights">Key insights for decision-making</h3>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Social determinants shape platform network effects</h2>
    <p>
      Individual digital literacy influences adoption, but uptake is also constrained
      by health literacy, economic status, and interpersonal dynamics such as
      patient–clinician relationships.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Platform strategy must account for intermediated adoption and trust dynamics</li>
      <li><strong>Risk if ignored:</strong> Fragmented uptake and weak network effects</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Socioeconomic variation affects adoption capacity</h2>
    <p>
      Differences in socioeconomic conditions affect both the ability and readiness
      to engage with digital health solutions across population segments.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Adoption strategies should be differentiated by context rather than uniform</li>
      <li><strong>Risk if ignored:</strong> Reduced cost-efficiency and limited reach</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Determinants of adoption are dynamic</h2>
    <p>
      Digital and health capabilities evolve over time as training, service availability,
      and disease-specific resources change.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Strategy should support iterative adjustment rather than fixed rollout</li>
      <li><strong>Risk if ignored:</strong> Missed upside and slower competitive response</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Local context is a binding constraint on scalability</h2>
    <p>
      Adoption outcomes vary substantially across geographies due to differences
      in health infrastructure, policy, and institutional arrangements.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Localisation must extend beyond digital adaptation</li>
      <li><strong>Risk if ignored:</strong> Strategic misfit and stalled scaling</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>How this informs decisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prioritisation:</strong> Focus on determinants shaping primary and community care contexts</li>
      <li><strong>Adoption and trust:</strong> Align product design with users’ digital and health literacy levels</li>
      <li><strong>Operating model:</strong> Segment by health system structure and care pathways</li>
      <li><strong>Equity and access:</strong> Treat inequities as structural constraints on network effects</li>
      <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Complement KPIs with indicators capturing institutional and social bottlenecks</li>
